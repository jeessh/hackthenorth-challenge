# Hack The North 2024 - Front End Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to build a tool to showcase events for both hackers and the public.

To access all events, login using a `Google` or `GitHub` account.

This challenge implementation was built using `React` + `CSS`.

The following dependencies were used on top of React:
- `react-router-dom`
- `@apollo/client`
- `momentJS`
- `auth0`
